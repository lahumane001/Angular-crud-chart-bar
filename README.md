I completed this Task Crud Operation and Bar-Chart using PrimeNg also I use Routing for Showing this three component.
Also I use Json-Server For Storing Data So If you want to run this code then you need to follow the below step .
Also I focused on functionality So design is not perfect.

step1 : open this link and clone the repository

step2: open terminal and add command "npm install"

step3: to run the json server we need to add "json-server --w db,json".

step4 : ng serve.
